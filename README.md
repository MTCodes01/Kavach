# Kavach
Report, Respond, Recover

## **Problem Statement**
In emergency situations like accidents or natural disasters, timely and accurate information is crucial for effective response. Emergency responders often face significant challenges due to delays in receiving essential details about incidents, including exact location, severity, and number of people involved. These delays can slow emergency services' response, potentially leading to preventable loss of life, prolonged injuries, and increased trauma for those affected. Current emergency reporting systems are often cumbersome, resulting in vital information being lost or poorly communicated, which hampers the overall effectiveness of emergency response.

## Solution
Kavach is a crowdsourced emergency reporting application designed to bridge the gap between real-time incident reporting and swift emergency response. The app allows users to quickly report accidents by submitting key details such as location, a description of the event, and photos. This functionality empowers users to act as real-time informants to emergency services, thereby facilitating a more effective response.
